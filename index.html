<h1><b><u>ECHIDNAS</b></u></h1><br>
<p>Echidnas are commonly referred to as <i> spiny anteaters</i> as the two are closely related. Echidnas, along with Platypuses, are the <b>only</b> mammals to lay eggs.</p>
<p><b>Unlike the Platypus,</b> the Echidna has adapted to live entirely on land, and is covered in tiny spikes.</p>

<p><b>What do Echidnas do?</b></p>
<p>Found mostly in Australia and New Zealand, Echidnas are <b>solitary</b> animals  with <i>no teeth</i>, so they spend their time digging through dirt and eating worms.</p>

<p><b>Did you know?</b></p>
<p>Echidnas are named after the Greek monster <i>Echidna</i>, who was a half-woman, half-snake, as the animal was perceived to have of both mammals and animals.</p>
<p>But don't worry! These creatures only weigh around 7-20lbs!</p>
