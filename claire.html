<h1><b><u>CLAIRE RUTTENCUTTER</b></u></h1>
<p><h2><b>Now introducing your new favorite person:</b></h2></p>
<p>At just 16 years old, Claire Ruttencutter is a mere few months away from finishing high school and facing the world head on as a computer scientist. Ruttencutter is a highly skilled coder and has plans to take over the world with her refined hacking skills.</p>

<p><h2><b>Okay so here's the rundown:</b></h2></p>
<p>Just like the rest of us, C-Rutt is an avid fan of <i>Grey's Anatomy</i> and John Green, specifically <i>Turtles All The Way Down</i>.</p>
<p>But be careful! Using the wrong "your," "you're," "their," "there," or "they're" will land you on her bad side faster than you can forget the difference between a contraction and and adjective. The grammar police never sleep!</p>

<p>Claire is a cancer, which means she's imaginative, loyal and emotional. Basically <b>she's the best person to have by your side on <i>any given day</i>.</b> </p>
<p>And when her head isn't in the stars, it's in the fields, picking radiant sunflowers that shine as brightly as she does!</p>

<p><b><h2>But wait! There's more!</b></h2></p>
<p>While Ruttencutter may appear to be a ghost on social media, you can find her name in shining lights and taking over the page of the playbill for her latest show.</p>
<p>She may not be singing or dancing, but she'll be stealing the spotlight regardless.</p>
